              Deborah has been with this practice for 20 years. She strives to
              make sure that everyone is treated to a warm welcoming relaxed
              atmosphere that makes even the nerviest patient feel at ease – her
              sense of humour helps too. “No one likes going to the dentist, so
              we try to make everyone feel relaxed and assure them that they are
              in good hands” Deborah is not only just the Practice Manager, she
              is called upon to assistant the dentist if one of our staff team
              is not available.
